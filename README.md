Milestone Project 1: Browser Game

<Requirements>
  -----------
~General Requirements----------->
  This is a solo project!
  Just to clarify, you may do the same game as another student, but you may not work together
  This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class
  This game must run in a web browser
  This game must be tracked in GitHub, with a minimum on 10 commits
  Ideally, put your empty project up on GitHub on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day
  This game must be deployed on GitHub Pages or another location
~Game Requirements------------>
  This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)
    The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI
    For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
  This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)
  When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts
  If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files
  Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
  The HTML code should use sematic tags
  The game should have a Readme.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the       technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
~Bonus Ideas------------>
  Make persistent scores in your browser's localStorage
  Add interesting music or sound effects to your game
<Deliverables>
  -----------
  A link to your game, which is deployed somewhere on the internet
