# Welcome to Yahtzee

Hello and Welcome to the Yahtzee Browser Game
I have been asked to make a game that would showcase what I've learned in the last few monthes.
This game is made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

<p align="center">you can <a href="https://augiedog.github.io/Yahtzee/"><b>Play</b></a> the Game here</p>
